   We’ve drafted these Terms of Service so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you.

   By using iubar app or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to these collectively as the “Services”), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.
